<h1>working with git</h1>
<h3>1. add files to your project</h3>
<p>this can be done via the touch command or through the interface as usual</p>
<p>examples <code>$touch index.html && touch main.css</code></p>
<h3>2. add new or modified files to staging</h3>
<p>once we add new files or modify existing files we can tell git to track then by adding them to staging fo the next commit<br>
  think of commts as chekpoints.  This will let git know what files the next checkpoint will consist of .</p>
  <p><code>$git add<filename></code></p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p><code>$git add . </code></p>

    <p>your files are now on stage to be included in the next commit/checkpoint</p>

    <h3>3. add a commit and a commit message</h3>
    <p>with your changes staged, you can creat the checkpoint in your work with the following command.</p>
    <code> $git commit -m "commit message" </code>
    <p>this command creates the checkpoint fo git! pretty simple</p>
    <h3>4. push your code</h3>
    <p>finally push your changes up to github with  the following command:</p>
    <pre>$ git push
